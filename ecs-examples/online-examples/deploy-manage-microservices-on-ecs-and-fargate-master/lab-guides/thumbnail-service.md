# Build and deploy Thumbnail-Service

In this section we will build and deploy the **thumbnail-service** as an ECS service. We will deploy the service on Container instances. The thumbnail-service is a daemon process and no external interactions happens with this service. This service monitors the SQS queue and creates thumbnails, no TCP ports are required to be exposed.

The ECS Task-Definition and Service-Definition are located in the thumbnail-service folder.

___

## Task 1 - Build thumbnail-service docker image

1. Navigate to the thumbnail-service folder

```bash
cd ./thumbnail-service
```

2. Create ECR Repository for thumbnail-service

```bash
# Note the repositoryUri - output of below command
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name ecs-workshop/thumbnail-service
```

3. Build the Docker Image for the thumbnail-service.

```bash
docker build -t <repositoryUri>:latest .
```

4. Login to Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

```bash
aws ecr get-login --no-include-email | bash
```

5. Push the Docker image to ECR

```bash
docker push <repositoryUri>:latest
```

## Task 2 - Deploy the thumbnail-service as ECS Service

1. Create a CloudWatch LogGroup to collect thumbnail-service logs.

```bash
aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name ecs-workshop/thumbnail-service
```

2. Let us now register the ECS Task Definition for the thumbnail-service. A **task-definition.json** is located in the thumbnail-service folder.

Let us set the environment variables in the task-definition.json. Replace the following parameter placeholders in the task-definition.json file with appropriate values.

|Parameter                           | Value                                   |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|&lt;ThumbnailServiceTaskRoleArn&gt; | ecs-workshop CloudFormation stack Output|
|&lt;repositoryUri&gt;               | ECR repository Uri of contacts-service  |
|&lt;AWS-REGION>                     | AWS Region e.g. us-east-1               |
|&lt;SqsQueueUrl>                    | ecs-workshop CloudFormation stack Output|

```bash
aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://task-definition.json
```

3. Create an ECS Service from the above Task Definition.

```bash
# Deploy the thumbnail-service
aws ecs create-service --cli-input-json file://service-definition.json

# Verify the thumbnail-service has been deployed successfully
# The command will wait till the service has been deployed. No output is returned.
aws ecs wait services-stable \
--cluster ecs-workshop-cluster \
--services thumbnail-service

# Verify the desired and running tasks for the service
aws ecs describe-services \
--cluster ecs-workshop-cluster \
--services thumbnail-service \
--query 'services[0].{desiredCount:desiredCount,runningCount:runningCount,pendingCount:pendingCount}'
```
